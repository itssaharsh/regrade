## Build memory protocol
- Before planning or changing a component: read `docs/memory/INDEX.md`; run
  `python3 .prod-build/pb.py mem find --paths <files> --terms <keywords>` and apply what fits.
- On any error: search failures by the error text first (`mem find --terms "<signature>"`); do not retry
  an approach a failure record says failed unless you have a new root cause.
- A record is a hint until its cited files still match (`mem check` flags stale ones).
- Run checks through `python3 .prod-build/pb.py run --task <ID> -- <command>` so results land in the
  evidence ledger; "done" means passing evidence exists, not that code was written.
- Task plan: `.prod-build/plan.json`. Reports: `.prod-build/reports/`. Delivery: `.prod-build/DELIVERY.md`.
